# Introduction
Welcome to the MOVIES APP, a React application that utilizes a real API to display movies from [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-GB). This app allows users to browse through a wide selection of movies and filter them by various criteria such as popularity, genres, and release date. Users can also view detailed information about each movie, including its trailers, reviews, and recommendations.

## Third-Party Libraries
The following libraries were used to build this app:

- Material UI for styling and UI components 
- React Router for client-side routing
- React JS as the main framework
